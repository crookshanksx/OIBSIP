## Level-1 Task Submission During Web-Dev Internship at Oasis Infobytes
## Task 1: Landing Page
For the first task, I developed a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks. The page features a sticky navbar and various CSS properties to enhance its visual appeal.

## Task 2: Portfolio
The second task was to create a responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS, with no frameworks. This project showcases my skills and work in a clean, user-friendly design.

## Task 3: Temperature Converter
The third task involved building a temperature converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, again without any frameworks. The converter allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit and displays the results with proper units. The website is fully responsive.
